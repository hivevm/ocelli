# Sensor: what a derived project acts on to take up the next release.
#
# The tag annotation and the GitHub release must say what a derived project does to take a
# release up (NUC-releases-are-semver-tags §2). Every hand-off says it under Doubts, in the field
# 'A derived project acts on' of .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md. The hand-off of a branch is the
# description of its pull request into main; a feat/ branch integrates linearly, so no other
# merge carries one (NUC-main-only-via-pr §5). For each merge of a pull request on the
# first-parent line of main since the last release tag, 'Merge pull request #<n> from …', the
# oldest first, this sensor prints that field, the lines that follow it indented included, and
# where it came from: the description, read through gh; where gh cannot read it, the merge
# message, if it carries the field. The subject and the gh call are those of
# scripts/sensor-work-measures.sh, its twin. Any other merge is not read.
#
# A field that says none, nothing, or '-' stands on one line, as do an empty field and a
# description without the field. The headline counts the merges listed. Whoever cuts the release
# writes the notes from this list (CONTRIBUTING.md → Cutting a release).
#
# It runs on a human's instruction, not in scripts/check-all.sh or checks.yml, since it reads
# GitHub (NUC-checks-are-bash §7). It reports and never fails. scripts/test-sensor-release-notes.sh
# runs it on fixture repositories: GH names the command that stands in for gh.
#
# Bash + coreutils + git + grep + sed + awk, plus the GitHub CLI, authenticated through its web
# flow (NUC-main-only-via-pr §3). Usage:
#     scripts/sensor-release-notes.sh [--root <dir>] [--since <tag>]
# The root defaults to this repository. The merges read are those in <tag>..HEAD; the tag
# defaults to the tag v* of the highest version reachable from HEAD. Exit code 0 always, except 2
# on an unknown argument, a root that does not exist or is no git repository, a missing gh, or no
# tag.
