# Documentation consistency checks for this repository.
#
# Enforces — as CI, not just convention — the documentation rules from AGENTS.md and
# docs/adr/README.md:
#
#   1. ADR index integrity: every ADR file, docs/adr/<CAT>-<slug>.md, but the 'NUC-' base,
#      which it lists in no row, is listed in the index
#      table in docs/adr/README.md once, every index row points to an existing file, and the
#      status and the 'Applies to' cell shown in the index match the **Status:** and **Applies
#      to:** lines inside each ADR — the index routes a reader from a change to the ADRs that bind
#      it (AGENTS.md, section 2), so a row that misstates what its ADR governs misroutes them.
#      A superseded or rejected row sits below the 'Superseded and rejected' heading and an
#      accepted or proposed one above it: the first table is what a session reads, and a
#      row in the wrong one is either a dead decision read as binding or a binding one
#      never read (docs/adr/README.md).
#   2. ADR identifier integrity: every identifier has the form of NUC-adrs-are-named-by-category
#      clause 1, its category is fixed or in the category list of the index (clause 2), and the
#      file's heading starts with '# <identifier>:'. No ADR deleted on the first-parent line of
#      HEAD carried the identifier; the message names the commit that deleted it, and a git that
#      cannot read the history fails the check. Every file in docs/adr/ named with letters before
#      a hyphen counts, so a misnamed ADR fails here, and so does a numbered ADR file, 'NNNN-*.md',
#      which no reader takes any more: a derived project maps it once, with the map script of the
#      normalize skill.
#   3. Relative-link integrity: every relative Markdown link in every tracked .md file resolves
#      to a file or directory that exists. Links inside fenced code blocks are illustrations,
#      not claims about files on disk, and are skipped (here and in check 6); so is a target that
#      still carries the placeholder '<CAT>' of docs/adr/template.md; an optional link
#      title ('[text](file "title")') is not part of the path. Reference-style links
#      ('[text][label]') are not resolved — this repository uses inline links only.
#
#      Checks 3 to 6 skip ⚪ superseded and 🔴 rejected ADRs (see is_inactive_adr): both
#      describe a repository state that does not exist, so holding their references against the
#      current tree would demand that it still contain what the project decided against.
#   4. Section-reference integrity: every section reference matches a numbered '## N.' heading
#      in AGENTS.md: the section sign followed by a number in Markdown, YAML, and shell files
#      and in the git hooks, and the words 'AGENTS.md, section N' in every text file but
#      Markdown. AGENTS.md is the only numbered document in this repository; extend the check if
#      another one appears. The headings there must themselves run 1..N in order: a gap or a
#      repeat is a botched renumbering, and it is the only half of the renumbering hazard a check
#      can see (NUC-documents-are-fixed §3). A clause citation, an ADR's identifier, a space, and
#      the section sign with a number or a list of them, cites that ADR and no section.
#   5. ADR-reference integrity: every identifier of a known category, a clause citation's among
#      them, names an ADR file that exists in docs/adr/ — anticipated follow-ups are described by
#      topic, never by an identifier that does not exist yet (NUC-adrs-are-named-by-category §6).
#      A reference is a word of its own: a one-word slug, such as API-first, or a longer chain is
#      none. An identifier in a Markdown code span is no citation (clause 6) and is not read.
#   6. ADR link agreement: a Markdown link whose text cites an ADR points at that ADR's own
#      file — the identifier and the file it links to must name the same decision
#      (docs/adr/README.md).
#   7. ADR header hygiene: every ADR's '**Status:**' line carries exactly one legend emoji and the
#      word that belongs to it, and no ADR still contains the instruction paragraph from
#      docs/adr/template.md — recognized by a needle read off that template, so rewording it
#      cannot silently disable the check. Check 1 compares index and file emoji-to-emoji, so a
#      leftover list of alternatives and a word contradicting its emoji both survive it — and the
#      word is what a reader believes (docs/adr/README.md). Every header field is the list item
#      '- **<Name>:** …' of template.md, since scripts/lib/adr.sh reads only that form: a field
#      in another form would pass here and be skipped by the binding ADRs sensor.
#   8. Supersession agreement: once the new ADR is accepted, its '**Supersedes:**' field and the
#      '⚪ superseded by <identifier>' status line of every old one it names — one, or several it
#      consolidates — name each other, in either form of identifier. While it is
#      proposed or rejected, no old one names it as its successor: only a human changes a status,
#      and the human flips the old lines when accepting the new one (docs/adr/README.md). A new
#      ADR superseded in its turn counts as accepted, so a chain stays whole. Check 1 cannot
#      see a missing half: it only mirrors the index against whatever status the file carries.
#      Every name of a Supersedes field counts, on whichever line it sits. No project ADR
#      supersedes a 'NUC-' ADR, and each clause an 'Extends:' or 'Narrows:' field names, as
#      'NUC-<slug> §n', is a numbered clause of that ADR's Decision (NUC-base-is-fixed §1).
#   9. Check-list agreement: the jobs of .github/workflows/checks.yml and the required status
#      checks named between the 'required-checks' markers in CONTRIBUTING.md list the same jobs, and
#      the workflows under .github/workflows/ and scripts/check-all.sh run the same scripts. A
#      check that runs in only one of them is a gate somebody believes in and does not have
#      (AGENTS.md, section 5). A job that runs no script under scripts/ fails too: its commands
#      run in CI and never in the local gate; a workflow check-all.sh names on a '# Not a gate:'
#      line, one that publishes rather than checks, is exempt, while the scripts it runs still
#      count. So does a script under scripts/ that neither list runs, unless check-all.sh names
#      it on an '# On instruction:' line. A job with a matrix reports one check run per entry, so
#      CONTRIBUTING.md names it by those, '<job> (<values>)', and never by its bare name.
#  10. Project Layout integrity: every path listed in the 'Project Layout' block of CONTRIBUTING.md
#      exists, a trailing '/' meaning a directory. The block is written by hand and nothing else
#      tells a reader that one of its lines has gone stale. A path with a '*' matches at least one
#      file, and docs/plan/ may be absent, since open work lives there only while there is some
#      (NUC-large-work-is-planned §2). The reverse holds for the top level only: every tracked
#      top-level file and directory is named, by itself or by a path under it. Below it the block
#      is a tour of the parts a newcomer needs, not a file listing.
#  11. Skills an agent reads: every skill under .agents/skills/ (a directory with a SKILL.md) has
#      a symlink of its name under .claude/skills/ that resolves to it, and every entry there is
#      such a symlink (NUC-procedures-are-skills §6); Claude Code reads only that directory, and a
#      copy drifts. Each SKILL.md opens with '---', closes with '---', and between them has a
#      'name' equal to its directory and a 'description' (§7); an unindented line there starts a
#      key or a '- ' item, as a wrap that hides the skill does not, and indented lines pass
#      unread. Each message says the fix. A repository with neither directory has nothing to check.
#  12. Base held by its blob list (NUC-base-is-fixed §2): every 'NUC-' file in
#      docs/adr/ and the rule file AGENTS.md has the git blob identifier its line in
#      docs/adr/NUC.blobs names, and every line names a file that exists. The template rewrites
#      the list in the commit that changes one, and a derived project never changes one. Without
#      a list the check passes when no 'NUC-' file exists, or when the Template release line of
#      README.md names the release a fork forked, 'vX.Y.Z, forked'.
#  13. Setup done: once TEMPLATE-SETUP.md is gone, each required role of ADR_ROLES in
#      scripts/lib/adr.sh has exactly one 🟢 accepted ADR whose 'Role:' field names it
#      (NUC-base-is-fixed §3), and none of the template's placeholders is left.
#      Step 1 of the setup: the project name NUC in the README title, its
#      intro, its Why NUC section, and the Dev Container name, the template's repository in the
#      README badges, the copyright holder in LICENSE, the security contact in SECURITY.md, the
#      reporting contact in CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, and a CODEOWNERS with no active rule or with its
#      TODO. Step 3: the '<Project Name>' title of the specification, the overview, the glossary, and the
#      conventions, a criterion of the specification still reading '…' or '<Quality', and the
#      scaffold's '<Part>', '<Term>', and '<Convention>' entries. Step 5: a 'TODO' as the Build,
#      Test, Lint, or Run command of the README, its Overview sentence, and its Usage TODO. A
#      placeholder that survives the setup describes the template, not the project. A file that
#      does not exist has nothing to check.
#  14. Template release named: README.md carries a '**Template release:**' line naming a
#      'vX.Y.Z' tag or 'unreleased' (NUC-releases-are-semver-tags §4). Tags do not travel with
#      GitHub's template mechanism, so the line is the one thing that tells a derived project
#      which release of the template it carries; a release moves it, and a project that takes a
#      release up moves it (§5).
#  15. Prose width: a line of Markdown prose is at most 100 columns, so a diff shows the sentence
#      that changed. Fenced code, front matter, table rows, headings, and ADR header fields are
#      exempt, and so is a line that cannot break, such as a link standing on a line of its own.
#      Superseded and rejected ADRs are not read, nor is a file .gitattributes marks
#      'linguist-generated', such as a changelog a tool writes. Indented code blocks are read as
#      prose.
#
# Checks 5 and 6 read every text file of the repository, not a list of documentation extensions:
# docs/adr/README.md states that code may reference an ADR, so a verifier restricted to
# documentation file types would leave the references most likely to go stale — those in source
# comments, which no reviewer reads alongside the ADR index — unchecked. Check 4 reads the
# section sign only in documentation file types on purpose: an ADR's identifier and the words
# 'AGENTS.md, section N' mean one thing wherever they appear, but '§' in source code is an
# ordinary character (see is_doc_file), and flagging it there would make a project's own string
# literals fail this repository's CI.
#
# Pure bash + coreutils/grep/sed/awk/find, plus git to enumerate the repository's files — all present
# in the Dev Container base image, so running it adds no toolchain and no dependency that would
# require an ADR.
#
# Usage:
#     scripts/check-docs.sh [repository root]        (or: bash scripts/check-docs.sh)
# The root defaults to this repository; scripts/test-check-docs.sh passes fixture repositories.
# Exit code 0 when all checks pass, 1 otherwise.
