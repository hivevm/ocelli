# Documentation consistency checks for this repository.
#
# Enforces — as CI, not just convention — the documentation rules from AGENTS.md and
# docs/adr/README.md. Each check is named by its rule key, which every finding it reports ends
# in, '[<key>:<reason>]', and which its function carries, 'check_<name>() {  # <key>'. This list
# is the one place that maps a key to its check; ADRs name the checks by it, and the binding ADRs
# sensor routes a change by it. An item may carry the keys its check had before,
# '#   <key> (was: <old>, …)': an ADR that names an old key still names the check, for the rule
# docs/adr-refs and for the sensor. A key moves so: the script first, its item carrying the old
# key, then the ADRs that name it, each commit green. The old key stays, since a derived
# project's ADR may name it. scripts/test-check-docs.sh fails on a key the script prints that
# the list lacks, and on a check that prints a key not its own. One key is no check's: docs/files,
# when the repository lists no text file and nothing else is checked.
#
#   docs/adr-index
#      ADR index integrity: every ADR file, docs/adr/<CAT>-<slug>.md, but the 'NUC-' base,
#      which it lists in no row, is listed in the index
#      table in docs/adr/README.md once, every index row points to an existing file, and the
#      status and the 'Applies to' cell shown in the index match the **Status:** and **Applies
#      to:** lines inside each ADR — the index routes a reader from a change to the ADRs that bind
#      it (AGENTS.md, section 2), so a row that misstates what its ADR governs misroutes them.
#      A superseded or rejected row sits below the 'Superseded and rejected' heading and an
#      accepted or proposed one above it: the first table is what a session reads, and a
#      row in the wrong one is either a dead decision read as binding or a binding one
#      never read (docs/adr/README.md).
#   docs/adr-identifiers (was: docs/adr-numbering)
#      ADR identifier integrity: every identifier has the form of NUC-adrs-are-named-by-category
#      clause 1, its category is fixed or in the category list of the index (clause 2), and the
#      file's heading starts with '# <identifier>:'. No ADR deleted on the first-parent line of
#      HEAD carried the identifier; the message names the commit that deleted it, and a git that
#      cannot read the history fails the check. Every file in docs/adr/ named with letters before
#      a hyphen counts, so a misnamed ADR fails here, and so does a numbered ADR file, 'NNNN-*.md',
#      which no reader takes any more: a derived project maps it once, with the normalize skill of a
#      v0.9 release.
#   docs/links
#      Relative-link integrity: every relative Markdown link in every tracked .md file resolves
#      to a file or directory that exists. Links inside fenced code blocks are illustrations,
#      not claims about files on disk, and are skipped (here and in docs/adr-link-targets);
#      so is a target that still carries the placeholder '<CAT>' of docs/adr/template.md; an
#      optional link title ('[text](file "title")') is not part of the path. Reference-style
#      links ('[text][label]') are not resolved — this repository uses inline links only.
#
#      The rules docs/links, docs/section-refs, docs/adr-refs, and docs/adr-link-targets skip ⚪
#      superseded and 🔴 rejected ADRs (see is_inactive_adr): both describe a repository state
#      that does not exist, so holding their references against the current tree would demand
#      that it still contain what the project decided against.
#   docs/section-refs
#      Section-reference integrity: every section reference matches a numbered '## N.' heading
#      in AGENTS.md: the section sign followed by a number in Markdown, YAML, and shell files
#      and in the git hooks, and the words 'AGENTS.md, section N' in every text file but
#      Markdown. AGENTS.md is the only numbered document in this repository; extend the check if
#      another one appears. The headings there must themselves run 1..N in order: a gap or a
#      repeat is a botched renumbering, and it is the only half of the renumbering hazard a check
#      can see (NUC-documents-are-fixed §3). A clause citation, an ADR's identifier, a space, and
#      the section sign with a number or a list of them, cites that ADR and no section.
#   docs/adr-refs
#      ADR-reference integrity: every identifier of a known category, a clause citation's among
#      them, names an ADR file that exists in docs/adr/ — anticipated follow-ups are described by
#      topic, never by an identifier that does not exist yet (NUC-adrs-are-named-by-category §6).
#      A reference is a word of its own: a one-word slug, such as API-first, or a longer chain is
#      none. An identifier in a Markdown code span is no citation (clause 6) and is not read.
#      Every rule key that the Applies to of an ADR in force names of scripts/check-docs.sh,
#      'the rule `<key>` of `scripts/check-docs.sh`', is an item of this header or an old key
#      one carries: a key that names no check binds the ADR to no check, and no check fails.
#   docs/adr-link-targets
#      ADR link agreement: a Markdown link whose text cites an ADR points at that ADR's own
#      file — the identifier and the file it links to must name the same decision
#      (docs/adr/README.md).
#   docs/adr-header
#      ADR header hygiene: every ADR's '**Status:**' line carries exactly one legend emoji and
#      the word that belongs to it, and no ADR still contains the instruction paragraph from
#      docs/adr/template.md — recognized by a needle read off that template, so rewording it
#      cannot silently disable the check. docs/adr-index compares index and file emoji-to-emoji,
#      so a leftover list of alternatives and a word contradicting its emoji both survive it —
#      and the word is what a reader believes (docs/adr/README.md). Every header field is the
#      list item '- **<Name>:** …' of template.md, since scripts/lib/adr.sh reads only that
#      form: a field in another form would pass here and be skipped by the binding ADRs sensor.
#   docs/adr-supersessions
#      Supersession agreement: once the new ADR is accepted, its '**Supersedes:**' field and the
#      '⚪ superseded by <identifier>' status line of every old one it names — one, or several it
#      consolidates — name each other, in either form of identifier. While it is
#      proposed or rejected, no old one names it as its successor: only a human changes a status,
#      and the human flips the old lines when accepting the new one (docs/adr/README.md). A new
#      ADR superseded in its turn counts as accepted, so a chain stays whole. docs/adr-index cannot
#      see a missing half: it only mirrors the index against whatever status the file carries.
#      Every name of a Supersedes field counts, on whichever line it sits. No project ADR
#      supersedes a 'NUC-' ADR, and each clause an 'Extends:' or 'Narrows:' field names, as
#      'NUC-<slug> §n', is a numbered clause of that ADR's Decision (NUC-base-is-fixed §1).
#   docs/check-lists
#      Check-list agreement: the jobs of .github/workflows/checks.yml and the required status
#      checks named between the 'required-checks' markers in CONTRIBUTING.md list the same jobs, and
#      the workflows under .github/workflows/ and scripts/check-all.sh run the same scripts. A
#      check that runs in only one of them is a gate somebody believes in and does not have
#      (AGENTS.md, section 5). A job that runs no script under scripts/ fails too: its commands
#      run in CI and never in the local gate; a workflow check-all.sh names on a '# Not a gate:'
#      line, one that publishes rather than checks, is exempt, while the scripts it runs still
#      count. So does a script under scripts/ that neither list runs, unless check-all.sh names
#      it on an '# On instruction:' line. A job with a matrix reports one check run per entry, so
#      CONTRIBUTING.md names it by those, '<job> (<values>)', and never by its bare name.
#   docs/project-layout
#      Project Layout integrity: every path listed in the 'Project Layout' block of CONTRIBUTING.md
#      exists, a trailing '/' meaning a directory. The block is written by hand and nothing else
#      tells a reader that one of its lines has gone stale. A path with a '*' matches at least one
#      file, and docs/plan/ may be absent, since open work lives there only while there is some
#      (NUC-large-work-is-planned §2). The reverse holds for the top level only: every tracked
#      top-level file and directory is named, by itself or by a path under it. Below it the block
#      is a tour of the parts a newcomer needs, not a file listing.
#   docs/skill-pointers
#      Skills an agent reads: every skill under .agents/skills/ (a directory with a SKILL.md) has
#      a symlink of its name under .claude/skills/ that resolves to it, and every entry there is
#      such a symlink (NUC-procedures-are-skills §6); Claude Code reads only that directory, and a
#      copy drifts. Each SKILL.md opens with '---', closes with '---', and between them has a
#      'name' equal to its directory and a 'description' (§7); an unindented line there starts a
#      key or a '- ' item, as a wrap that hides the skill does not, and indented lines pass
#      unread. Each message says the fix. A repository with neither directory has nothing to check.
#   docs/base-blobs
#      Base held by its blob list (NUC-base-is-fixed §2): every 'NUC-' file in
#      docs/adr/ and the rule file AGENTS.md has the git blob identifier its line in
#      docs/adr/NUC.blobs names, and every line names a file that exists. The template rewrites
#      the list in the commit that changes one, and a derived project never changes one. Without
#      a list the check passes when no 'NUC-' file exists, or when the Template release line of
#      README.md names the release a fork forked, 'vX.Y.Z, forked'.
#   docs/template-identity
#      Setup done: once TEMPLATE-SETUP.md is gone, each required role of ADR_ROLES in
#      scripts/lib/adr.sh has exactly one 🟢 accepted ADR whose 'Role:' field names it
#      (NUC-base-is-fixed §3), and none of the template's placeholders is left.
#      Step 1 of the setup: the project name NUC in the README title, its
#      intro, its Why NUC section, and the Dev Container name, the template's repository in the
#      README badges, the copyright holder in LICENSE, the security contact in SECURITY.md, the
#      reporting contact in CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, and a CODEOWNERS with no active rule or with its
#      TODO. Step 3: the '<Project Name>' title of the specification, the overview, the glossary, and the
#      conventions, a criterion of the specification still reading '…' or '<Quality', and the
#      scaffold's '<Part>', '<Term>', and '<Convention>' entries. Step 5: a 'TODO' as the Build,
#      Test, Lint, or Run command of the README, its Overview sentence, and its Usage TODO. The
#      close: the issue template .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/template-finding.md, whose findings go to
#      the template's repository (NUC-template-learns-from-projects §6). A placeholder that
#      survives the setup describes the template, not the project. A file that does not exist has
#      nothing to check.
#   docs/opens-no-issue
#      No file of the template opens an issue on its own: only a human sends a finding
#      (NUC-template-learns-from-projects §4). While TEMPLATE-SETUP.md exists, the repository is
#      the template, and the rule reads every text file under scripts/, .githooks/, .github/, and
#      .agents/ but the fixture tables under scripts/fixtures/, which nothing runs. After the
#      setup the files are the project's, and the rule reads none. A line whose first non-space
#      character is '#' is a comment and is not read; a trailing '# comment' on a command line is
#      read with it. A line that ends in a backslash goes on in the next one. A line fails in five
#      plain forms, each its reason:
#        cli      'gh issue create', or its alias 'gh issue new';
#        api      'gh api' on a path that ends in 'repos/…/issues', with '-X POST', '--method
#                 POST', or a field, '-f', '-F', '--field', '--raw-field', or '--input', and with
#                 no '-X GET', '--method GET', or '--request GET';
#        graphql  the mutation 'createIssue(', anywhere on the line;
#        http     curl or wget on that path with a POST or with data: '-X POST', '--request
#                 POST', '-d', '--data…', '--json', '--post-data', or '--post-file';
#        script   the call 'issues.create(', as actions/github-script makes it, or a step
#                 'uses:' an action whose name holds 'create-issue' or 'create-an-issue'.
#      Prose in Markdown is read too: a skill's sentence is an instruction to an agent, which is
#      what clause 4 guards. A skill names the human's act, such as 'the human sends the finding
#      as an issue', not the command. Reading issues passes, as does a link to an issues page.
#      The rule reads text: it misses a command built from variables, a shell alias, a list of
#      arguments such as Python's '["gh", "issue", "create"]', a client in another language, and
#      a mutation whose name and parenthesis stand on two lines. The review holds the rest, as the
#      Enforcement of that ADR says.
#   docs/template-release
#      Template release named: README.md carries a '**Template release:**' line naming a
#      'vX.Y.Z' tag or 'unreleased' (NUC-releases-are-semver-tags §4). Tags do not travel with
#      GitHub's template mechanism, so the line is the one thing that tells a derived project
#      which release of the template it carries; a release moves it, and a project that takes a
#      release up moves it (§5).
#      A change that moves the version on the line against its merge base with origin/main, else
#      main, cuts a release or takes one up, and then each 🟡 proposed 'NUC-' ADR fails (clause 8): a
#      derived project can neither accept nor reject one. A base without the line counts as none.
#      Without a merge base the line is read alone.
#   docs/prose-width
#      Prose width: a line of Markdown prose is at most 100 columns, so a diff shows the sentence
#      that changed. Fenced code, front matter, table rows, headings, and ADR header fields are
#      exempt, and so is a line that cannot break, such as a link standing on a line of its own.
#      Superseded and rejected ADRs are not read, nor is a file .gitattributes marks
#      'linguist-generated', such as a changelog a tool writes. Indented code blocks are read as
#      prose.
#
# The rules docs/adr-refs and docs/adr-link-targets read every text file of the repository,
# not a list of documentation extensions: docs/adr/README.md states that code may reference an
# ADR, so a verifier restricted to documentation file types would leave the references most
# likely to go stale — those in source comments, which no reviewer reads alongside the ADR
# index — unchecked. docs/section-refs reads the section sign only in documentation file
# types on purpose: an ADR's identifier and the words 'AGENTS.md, section N' mean one thing
# wherever they appear, but '§' in source code is an ordinary character (see is_doc_file),
# and flagging it there would make a project's own string literals fail this repository's CI.
#
# Pure bash + coreutils/grep/sed/awk/find, plus git to enumerate the repository's files — all present
# in the Dev Container base image, so running it adds no toolchain and no dependency that would
# require an ADR.
#
# Usage:
#     scripts/check-docs.sh [--root <dir>]        (or: bash scripts/check-docs.sh)
# The root defaults to this repository; scripts/test-check-docs.sh passes fixture repositories.
# Exit code 0 when all checks pass, 1 otherwise, and 2 on an argument it does not read
# or a root that is no directory.

# title ('AGENTS.md#3-adr-rules'): renumbering or retitling a section makes that anchor stop
# resolving, and docs/links fails on every reference to it. This check verifies the other half
# — that the number in the text and the anchor the link points at name the same section.
#
# Named gap (AGENTS.md, section 5): outside Markdown there are no links, so a '§N' in a workflow or
# a script comment is still only checked for the number existing. Those references live in files a
# maintainer edits next to AGENTS.md; the weaker guarantee is recorded here rather than hidden.
