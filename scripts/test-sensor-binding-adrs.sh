# Self-test of scripts/sensor-binding-adrs.sh. Verifies: NUC-decisions-are-proposed-then-accepted
#
# Each case builds a throwaway git repository with ADRs under docs/adr/, commits a change on
# top of a tagged base, runs the sensor against the base, and asserts the exit code and a line a
# reader would meet. The cases cover a directory path and a file path in an Applies to line, a
# path its prose only resembles, an ADR no longer in force, an ADR the change itself adds, a
# change no ADR names, nothing to compare, and a base that does not resolve; a Rust file binds the
# modules under the directory of its name, a Rust library root and a file of another kind do not.
# Paths named with --path stand in for a change, and --sections prints the header, Decision, and
# Enforcement of each ADR listed, and nothing else of it, under a banner that names the sections
# ADR_RULE_SECTIONS lists, and the Applies to of each other ADR in force whose Applies to is
# prose, read from the ADR files and never from the index, also where the prose comes before a
# list longer than a pipe holds. A 'NUC-' ADR of the base binds like any other, read from its file.
# A change inside one numbered check binds the ADRs that name that check, any other line every ADR
# that names the file; the numbers the checks of scripts/check-docs.sh carry are its header items.
