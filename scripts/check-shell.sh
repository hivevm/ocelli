#
# Shell lint for this repository.
#
# Runs ShellCheck over every shell script of the repository: every '*.sh' file git does not
# ignore, and the git hooks under .githooks/, which git requires to be named without an extension.
# The files come from git, as in every other check, so a script under .scratch/ or under a build
# directory the project ignores is no part of the gate. The scripts under scripts/ and the hooks
# are the repository's entire enforcement layer, so they are held to a lint gate themselves.
#
# ShellCheck is the one check dependency beyond bash + coreutils/git. CI does not install it — the
# GitHub-hosted runner image ships it preinstalled, and the Dev Container installs it on creation
# (.devcontainer/devcontainer.json). Elsewhere, when shellcheck is not on PATH, the check skips
# it with a notice (CI remains the gate); in a CI run (CI=true) it is an error, never a silent skip.
#
# Beyond ShellCheck it refuses GNU sed's in-place flag, `sed -i`, which BSD sed on macOS reads as
# taking a suffix: check-all.sh, and with it the pre-push hook, runs on any host. Comment lines are
# not read. The rule reads the options right after `sed`, so it misses a flag after a script
# (`sed -e S -i f`), and it reads text, so it flags the words inside a quoted string or after a
# trailing comment; spell those differently.
#
# It refuses a pipe into grep with -q (or --quiet, --silent) as well. Under pipefail, grep exits
# at its first match, and a producer that writes on after that dies of SIGPIPE: the pipeline fails
# and reads as no match, but only when the scheduler runs grep between two writes, so under load.
# A here-string, a variable, or grep -c reads the input whole. A script whose shebang names sh and
# that sets no pipefail is spared: its pipe has grep's status, and sh has no here-string. The same
# limits as for sed apply: comment lines are not read, the rule reads text, and a pipe on the line
# before is not seen, nor is pipefail set in a file the script sources.
#
# Three rules carry rule keys; their cases are the table scripts/fixtures/check-shell.txt.
# The rules shell/bash-floor and shell/root start the scripts they hold, from an empty directory of
# their own and, for a script the root rule holds, with --root on it. A script is held only by a
# line of its own that asks for it, so a project's script without one is never started. One whose
# floor does not stop it, and that the root rule does not hold, such as a self-test, runs in full.
#
#   shell/mode
#      A tracked script scripts/*.sh, or a skill's .agents/skills/<name>/*.sh, has the mode 100755
#      in the index (NUC-checks-are-bash §9), '[shell/mode:exec]'. Each is run, and AGENTS.md calls
#      some directly, which a file without the executable bit refuses. The rule reads the mode with
#      git ls-files -s, so it holds on a file system that keeps no mode, as on Windows. A file below
#      scripts/ or below a skill's directory is not held: a library under scripts/lib/ is sourced,
#      not run, and stays 100644, and a fixture under scripts/fixtures/ is data. A file git does not
#      track has no mode in the index and is not held until it is added.
#      A symbolic link, mode 120000, is not held: git keeps no executable bit for it. A file in
#      conflict is not held: it has no entry at stage 0, and its mode is open until it is resolved.
#      A finding names the command that sets the bit, the path quoted for the shell.
#   shell/bash-floor
#      A script scripts/*.sh, or a skill's .agents/skills/<name>/*.sh, with a line that sources
#      lib/bash.sh or lib/selftest.sh stops below bash 4.4 with exit 2, its file name, and both
#      versions (NUC-checks-are-bash §1), as BASH_GUARD_VERSION=3.2 makes the floor believe.
#   shell/root
#      A script scripts/*.sh but the self-tests and check-all.sh calls enter_root of
#      scripts/lib/root.sh on a line of its own, and exits 2 with its file name on --verbose and
#      on a --root that is no directory (NUC-checks-are-bash §9). A finding names the call and the
#      Project Layout of CONTRIBUTING.md, where a project reads the rule. A script that declares
#      a positional argument and changes into it passes: the rule runs the script, and reads no
#      cd in its text.
#      An option whose branch in the script reads a value after it, '$2', stands in the usage
#      string as '--<name> <value>', the one place enter_root reads which options take a value,
#      '[shell/root:valued]'. The branch is a case label '--<name>)', quoted or with alternatives
#      after it, or a test '== "--<name>"', and the value is read on its line or the four after it,
#      before ';;', a shift alone, 'set -- "${@:2}"', or a 'fi', 'done', or 'esac'; an option
#      shifted alone is a flag. One read as
#      'shift; x="$1"' is not seen. The usage is read from the script's first line 'usage="', with
#      usage_valued of scripts/lib/root.sh, as enter_root reads it.
#
# Usage:
#     scripts/check-shell.sh [--root <dir>]        (or: bash scripts/check-shell.sh)
# The root defaults to this repository; scripts/test-check-shell.sh passes fixtures. The rules
# shell/bash-floor and shell/root start the scripts of the root they read.
# Exit code 0 when all scripts pass (ShellCheck skipped when unavailable outside CI), 1 otherwise,
# 2 on a root that is no directory.
